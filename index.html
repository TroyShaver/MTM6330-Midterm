      <h2>The Birth of a Brand</h2>
      <p>Supreme was founded in 1994 by British entrepreneur James Jebbia. Growing up in Crawley, Sussex, Jebbia moved
        to New York City in 1983 where he landed a job at Parachute; a minimalist skate shop and clothing store in
        SoHo. In 1989, he branched out on his own and opened his first retail venue, a small boutique called “Union
        NYC”. His boutique carried a mix of mostly English brands but one of Union’s best selling brands was Stussy.
        Through this, James became good friends with Shawn Stussy, the Founder of Stussy, and in 1991, they opened
        Stussy NYC.</p>

          Jebbia spent a lot of time observing the downtown skate scene. In doing so, he felt there lacked a place
          where skaters could both hang out and buy skateboard hardware and clothing. Following Stussy’s departure, he
          decided to pick familiar faces from the local skate scene and hired them on as employees. With this, Supreme
          first opened their doors in April 1994 on Lafayette Street, New York City. The original Supreme store was
          made very open concept so skaters could come right in with their skateboards. Jebbia wanted to make Supreme
          more than just a retail store. Word of Supreme travelled after Japanese tourists took a liking to the brand
          and a few Supreme boutiques were opened in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Osaka during the late 90’s.

        <p>Although supreme has and forever will have skateboarding at its core, it has evolved into much more than
          just a skate shop. It can now be described as a successful lifestyle brand as well as a global phenomenon.
          Throughout the years, Supreme has collaborated with several respected and established brands such as The
          North Face, Nike, Vans and Comme des Garcons. Additionally, Supreme is now worn by a huge cross section of
          people, rather than just the skater community. Supreme, once a small store in NYC has now turned into a
          billion-dollar streetwear brand. </p>
