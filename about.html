      <h2>What Makes Supreme Unique?</h2>
      <p>The majority of Skate brands were founded in California with West Coast skaters in mind. In its early years,
        Supreme’s products were specifically designed with East Coast skaters in mind. Which is why Jebbia put such an
        emphasis on higher quality products; due to New York’s harsher seasons. The now “iconic” Supreme Box Logo
        t-shirt, originally released for opening day in 1994, continues to remain one of, if not the most, sought out
        item from the brand. Throughout the years, Supreme has become increasingly more difficult to buy due to all the
        additional hype that now surrounds the brand. Supreme now does 2 seasons per year, releasing products every
        Thursday throughout the season. Although nothing Supreme puts out will ever be classified as “limited”,
        products are produced in limited quantities so that they don't get stuck with stuff nobody wants. </p>

        <h2>A Billion Dollar Empire</h2>
        <img src="img/skater.jpg" alt="skater">
        <p>Supreme streetwear has garnered thousands upon thousands devoted fans wanting the new line the clothing
          brand has to offer. The first Supreme store opened in 1994, and only costs around 12,000$.Just a few years
          back it was shown that Supreme sold a 50 percent stake in its business to the Carlyle Group for a reported
          $500 million, and raises a number of questions. This proves the sheer power of Supreme, establishing itself
          as a billion dollar empire. </p>
